This folder includes dataset, example results and analysis code for temperature and pH dependent MD simulation of C-peptide.
The trajectory are *.nc and initial conformation is s.pdb.

Supporting softwares :
MSMBuilder, MdTraj, conda, python and python libraries

Execute the cpeptide.py to perform the analysis and find out the distribution of congormation on FEL.

The single code is splitted into 5 sections for detailed analysis which includes
1. data preprocessing 
2. common fel construction of all pH and temperature simulated trajectories
3. quantification of conformation on fel
4. quantification of pH dependent conformations on FEL
5. tracing path of pH dependent trajectories on FEL.
