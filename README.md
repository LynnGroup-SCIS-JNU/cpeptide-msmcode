# **cpeptide-msmcode**

pH dependent state transition of c-peptide and evaluation of conformations on FEL at various temperature.

The single code is splitted into 5 sections for detailed analysis which includes
1. Data preprocessing 
2. Common fel construction of all pH and temperature simulated trajectories
3. Quantification of conformation on fel
4. Quantification of pH dependent conformations on FEL
5. Tracing path of pH dependent trajectories on FEL. 

## Package content
